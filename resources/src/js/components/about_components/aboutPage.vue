            Use NOMI (Names of Matador Individuals) to learn your students’ names.
            Learning your students’ names positively affects their attitudes about
            the course by making them feel that they are part of an inclusive environment.

            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Connect the names in your class roster with actual photos</li>
                <li>Test yourself with Flash Card mode to see how many names you can remember</li>
                <li>NOMI auto-populates with photos that faculty have already uploaded, making it easier for you to get a head start in learning student names</li>
                <li>Capture photos of students directly in NOMI or upload photos to student pages</li>
                <li>Add personal notes to student pages to help remember student names, interests, and more</li>
                <li>View your list of classes for the current semester</li>
            </ul>

            The web applications developed and maintained by META+LAB are designed and tested to work on the most current versions of major desktop web browsers, minus one version: <b>Mozilla Firefox</b>, <b>Google Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b>.
            Part of the mantra at META+LAB involves pushing boundaries. The use of such state-of-the-art technology will rely on the newest features and functionality available on browsers.

        <p>
            Some functionality is not currently supported on <b>Chrome</b> for Android. If you are using an Android device, we recommend using <b>Firefox</b> instead.
