            Use NOMI (Names of Matador Individuals) to learn your students’ names.
            Learning your students’ names positively affects their attitudes about
            the course by making them feel that they are part of an inclusive environment.

            <ul>
                <li>Connect the names in your class roster with actual photos</li>
                <li>Test yourself with Flash Card mode to see how many names you can remember</li>
                <li>NOMI auto-populates with photos that faculty have already uploaded, making it easier for you to get a head start in learning student names</li>
                <li>Capture photos of students directly in NOMI or upload photos to student pages</li>
                <li>Add personal notes to student pages to help remember student names, interests, and more</li>
                <li>View your list of classes for the current semester</li>
            </ul>
